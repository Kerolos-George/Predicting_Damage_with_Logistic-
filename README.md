# Predicting_Damage_with_Logistic-
Predicting-Earthquake-Damage-in-Nepal
This project uses data from Open Data Nepal to build a model using Decision Tree algorithm to predict building damage from the Nepal 2015 Earthquake. The goal is to create a model that when given the characteristics of a builing can accurately predict if the building will suffer severe damage or not in a similar type of earthquake.

## Data
